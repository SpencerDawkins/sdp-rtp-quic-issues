# Issues for "RTP over QUIC" and "Media Over QUIC" that may impact SDP for these technologies 

This is the working area for tracking issues under discussion about "RTP Over QUIC" and "Media Over QUIC" that may impact SDP for these technologies. 

At this time, please use this repository for adding and discussing issues that will be reflected in "SDP Offer/Answer for RTP using QUIC as Transport" as they are resolved. Spencer will be reporting out discussions to AVTCORE and to the MOQ mailing list. 

This repository is used for a draft defining SDP usage for RTP with QUIC as its underlying transport protocol. The draft is draft-dawkins-avtcore-rtp-quic-issues-sdp.

Issues and pull requests on the current document text are welcomed here.

Issues that are not incuded in the current document text are better directed to [a dedicated issue tracker repository] (https://github.com/SpencerDawkins/sdp-rtp-quic-issues), where issues involving boiling the sdp-rtp-quic-issues ocean are more likely to be in scope. 

From the Abstract:

This document is a companion document to "SDP Offer/Answer for RTP using QUIC as Transport". That document focuses on the description and registration of SDP "proto" attribute parameters with IANA, to allow applications that rely on SDP Offer/Answer to negotiate the QUIC protocol as an encapsulation for RTP.

This document is intended to capture issues that have arisen, been discussed by the AVTCORE working group, and have reached a resolution that can be included in "SDP Offer/Answer for RTP using QUIC as Transport".
